# Butterfly Budgeting

## Description:

Butterfly budgeting is an app designed to give the user an understanding of their allocation of spending. It provides the user with a comfortable format to input and breakdown their expenditures so as to understand how best to reach their desired financial futures. Finally, it formats a clear budget as a record of their current distribution of spending to refer to over time.

## Functionality

The app begins by asking the user for their monthly income (or 4 weeks of take home pay). The app then moves onto calculating the amount the user spends on essential spending. This includes items such as rent, mortgage, insurance, groceries, transport etc. - all those items that are essential for day to day living. The user is provided with some suggestions, and then prompted to add their own. After these figures are totalled up, the user can then have an idea of how much is left over for other spending.

Next the user is asked to allocate some of their remaining funds to the non essential items, or supplementary items. This includes those items such as shopping, takeaway coffee, dining or drinking out, events or hobbies. The user can then be provided with an idea of how much they're willing to spend on each of these items and how much of their total budget after essentials this amounts to.

The user then is directed to consider any goals in the future they'd like to put their savings towards. These may be large items like a car or a debt they're trying to pay off, or smaller items like new shoes. The user inputs the item, its cost and the percentage of their savings they would like to put toward the item. They then recieve a calculation of the amount of months it will take to pay this item off.

Finally all the information is grouped together and the user is provided with a clearly laid out final budget for them to copy and keep as a reference over time.
