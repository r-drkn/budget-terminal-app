#Budget App

##Statement of purpose

###Description:

Butterfly is a budgeting app designed to give the user an understanding of their allocation of spending. It provides the user with a comfortable format to input and view their expenditures and suggestions of where and how to alter this spending to reach their desired financial futures. Finally, it formats a clear budget as a record of their current distribution of spending to refer to over time.

###Functionality

The program begins by asking the user for their monthly income (or 4 weeks of take home pay). The app then moves onto calculating the amount the user spends on essential spending. This includes items such as rent, mortgage, insurance, groceries, transport etc. - all those items that are essential for day to day living. Should they like, the program can provide the user with some suggestions. After these figures are totalled up, the user can then have an idea of how much is left over for other spending.

Next the user is asked to allocate some of their remaining funds to the non essential items, or supplementary items. This includes those items such as shopping, takeaway coffee, dining or drinking out, events or hobbies. The user can then be provided with an idea of how much they're willing to spend on each of these items and how much of their total budget after essentials this amounts to.

The user is then prompted to consider any debts they'd like to allocate spending towards, and the terms at which they'd ideally like to pay off these debts. They can formulate a plan for both the term and
